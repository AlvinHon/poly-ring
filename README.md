# Polynomial Ring Z_p\[X\]/(X^n + 1)

This library provides arithmetic operations over a specific polynomial ring `Z_p\[X\]/(X^n + 1)` implemented in a compact and efficient manner. I.e. the ring of polynomials over `Z` of degree at most n-1 for `n` some power of two. This ring is commonly used in lattice based cryptosystems.
